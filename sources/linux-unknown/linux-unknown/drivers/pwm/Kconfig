	  Generic Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) support.

	  In Pulse-Width Modulation, a variation of the width of pulses
	  in a rectangular pulse signal is used as a means to alter the
	  average power of the signal. Applications include efficient
	  power delivery and voltage regulation. In computer systems,
	  PWMs are commonly used to control fans or the brightness of
	  display backlights.

	  This framework provides a generic interface to PWM devices
	  within the Linux kernel. On the driver side it provides an API
	  to register and unregister a PWM chip, an abstraction of a PWM
	  controller, that supports one or more PWM devices. Client
	  drivers can request PWM devices and use the generic framework
	  to configure as well as enable and disable them.

	  This generic framework replaces the legacy PWM framework which
	  allows only a single driver implementing the required API. Not
	  all legacy implementations have been ported to the framework
	  yet. The framework provides an API that is backward compatible
	  with the legacy framework so that existing client drivers
	  continue to work as expected.

	  If unsure, say no.
